## Usage

To send an email:

```c#
var transmission = new Transmission();
transmission.Content.From.Email = "testing@sparkpostbox.com";;
transmission.Content.Subject = "Oh hey!";
transmission.Content.Text = "Testing SparkPost - the world\'s most awesomest email service!";
transmission.Content.Html = "<html><body><p>Testing SparkPost - the world\'s most awesomest email service!</p></body></html>";

var recipient = new Recipient
{
    Address = new Address { Email = "my@email.com" }
};
transmission.Recipients.Add(recipient);

var client = new Client("<YOUR API KEY>");
client.Transmissions.Send(transmission);

```

To send a template email:

```c#
var transmission = new Transmission();
transmission.Content.TemplateId = "my-template-id";
transmission.Content.From.Email = "testing@sparkpostbox.com";

transmission.SubstitutionData["first_name"] = "John";
transmission.SubstitutionData["last_name"] = "Doe";

var orders = new List<Order>
{
    new Order { OrderId = "1", Total = 101 },
    new Order { OrderId = "2", Total = 304 }
};

// you can pass more complicated data, so long as it
// can be parsed easily to JSON
transmission.SubstitutionData["orders"] = orders;

var recipient = new Recipient
{
    Address = new Address { Email = "my@email.com" }
};
transmission.Recipients.Add(recipient);

var client = new Client("MY_API_KEY");
client.Transmissions.Send(transmission);

```
